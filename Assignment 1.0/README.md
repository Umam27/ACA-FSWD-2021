## TERMS RELATED TO WEB DEV

### CLIENT-SERVER MODEL
      IN THIS MODEL WE HAVE A CENTRAL HOST CALLED *SERVER* AND SEVERAL OTHER PROCESSORS WHICH CONNECT TO IT ARE CALLED ITS *CLIENT*.
      THE SERVER WAITS FOR THE REQUESTS BY THE CLIENTS AND THEN PROVIDE IT WITH THE FACILITY. HERE THE SERVER SITS ANYWHERE AND THE
      CLIENTS CAN ACCESS IT FROM ANYWHERE ELSE. THIS STRUCTURE PROVIDES STANDARD TRANSPARENCY i.e. THE CLIENTS DO NOT NEED TO KNOW
      THE COMPLICACIES OF THE SERVER(*HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE*).

      THIS IS BETTER THAN THE OLD **MAINFRAME MODEL** AS IT DOES NOT CONSIDER ITS CLIENTS AS "DUMB".
      THE CLIENTS CAN PERFORM THEIR INDEPENDANT OPERATIONS EVEN WHILE FETCHING UTILITY FROM THE SERVER.

### CLIENT SIDE
      IT REFERS TO THE OPERATIONS PEFORMED BY THE CLIENT IN THE CLIENT SERVER RELATION. A CLIENT CAN BE ANY COMPUTER 
      WHICH CONNECTS TO THE SEREVER AS NEEDED.THIS IS NECESSARY AS THE CLIENT MAY NEED TO PERORM OPERATION OR FUNCTIONS
      OR ACCESS THE INFORMATION WHICH MAY BE NOT AVAILABLE ON THE USER. IT IS HEPLFUL AS SERVER MAY NOT PERFORM THE OPERATION
      TIMELY TO ALL OF ITS SERVERS AT THE SAME TIME. IT ASLO IS MUCH MORE SECURE THAN WORKING ON THE SERVER EVERYTIME WHICH 
      MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF CYBER ATTACKS.

### SERVER SIDE
      AS THE CLIENT SIDE, THE SERVER SIDE REFERS TO OPERATIONS THAT A SERVER PERFORMS IN CLIENT SERVER RELATION. OPERATIONS 
      NEED TO BE PERFORMED ON THE SERVER SIDE AS THE CLEINT MAY BE SLOW, UNRELIABLE OR INSECURE. IT INLCUDE BOTH THE OPERATIONS
      - THE CLIENT RELATED TASKS AND THE NON CLIENT OPERATIONS SUCH AS MAINTAINENCE TASKS.

### HTTP (*HYPER TEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL*)
      IT WAS DEVELOPED BY **TIM BERNERS LEE ** IN 1989.
      
      IT IS A PROTOCOL USED TO FETCH INFORMATION FROM THE SERVER USING REQUESTS. IT IS USED TO LOAD WEBPAGES USING THE *HYPERLINKS*.
      IT IS AN **APPLICATION LAYER PROTOCOL** DESINED TO TRANSFER INFORMATION BETWEEN NETWORK DEVICES.  IT IS A PROTOCOL BY WHICH THE 
      THE CLIENT REQUESTS THE SERVER USING LINK.
      IT IS A **REQUEST-RESPONSE** PROTOCOL IN THE CLIENT- SERVER MODEL. 

      FOR EG.- THE WEB BROWSER MAY BE THE CLIENT AND THE APPLICATION RUNNING THE WEBSITE MAY BE THE HOST(SERVER) WHO IS HOSTING THE WEBSITE.
               THE CLIENT SUNMITS HTTP REQUESTS FOR THE RESOURCE AND THE SERVER, ON ITS PART PROVIDES IT WITH **HTML** LINKS OR INFORMATIONS 
               OR GIVES A RESPONSE MESSAGE ON CLIENTS'S BEHALF.

### HTTP VS HTTPS
      
    HTTP   |   HTTPS
    -------|--------
    HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL| HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL WITH SECURE
    VULNERABLE TO HACKING AND CYBER ATTACKS | MORE SECURE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE CLIENT AND THE SERVER
    OPERATES ON TCP\IP LEVEL  | NO SEPRATE WORKING, BUT WORKS ON HTTP WITH A SSL\TSL ENCRYPTION
    SUITABLE FOR WEBSITES WIHT REGULAR ENTRY SUCH AS BLOGS| SUITABLE FOR WEBSITES HANDLING CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATIOn SUCH AS CREDIT CARD.

### FRAMEWORK VS LIBRARIES
    
    LIBRARY IS A COLLECTION OF REUSABLE FUNCTIONS USED BY COMPUTER PROGRAMS MEANING THE RESOURCES WHICH YOU CAN REUSE WHICH MAY INCLUDE CLASSESS, PRE-COMPILED CODE, MESSAGE TEMPLATE, etc. ALMOST EVERY PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE HAVE THEIR OWN STANDARD LIBRARIES BUT PROGRAMMERS CAN ALSO CREATE THEIR OWN. THE CONTROL IN LIBRARY IS OURS. WE CALL IT DURING THE PROGRAM.

    FRAMEWORK, AS THE NAME SUGGESTS IS THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE CODE. IT MAJORLY EMPHASISES ON REUSABILITY OF DESIGN RATHER THAN REUSABILITY OF CODE. THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE IN IT IS THE "THE INVERSION OF CONTROL". THE FRAMEWORK HAS THE CONTROL IN ITS HANDS. WE DONT CALL IT DURING THE CODE, IT CALLS US.
