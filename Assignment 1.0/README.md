## TERMS RELATED TO WEB DEV

#### CLIENT-SERVER MODEL
      IN THIS MODEL WE HAVE A CENTRAL HOST CALLED *SERVER* AND SEVERAL OTHER PROCESSORS WHICH CONNECT TO IT ARE CALLED ITS *CLIENT*.
      THE SERVER WAITS FOR THE REQUESTS BY THE CLIENTS AND THEN PROVIDE IT WITH THE FACILITY. HERE THE SERVER SITS ANYWHERE AND THE
      CLIENTS CAN ACCESS IT FROM ANYWHERE ELSE. THIS STRUCTURE PROVIDES STANDARD TRANSPARENCY i.e. THE CLIENTS DO NOT NEED TO KNOW
      THE COMPLICACIES OF THE SERVER(*HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE*).

      THIS IS BETTER THAN THE OLD **MAINFRAME MODEL** AS IT DOES NOT CONSIDER ITS CLIENTS AS "DUMB".
      THE CLIENTS CAN PERFORM THEIR INDEPENDANT OPERATIONS EVEN WHILE FETCHING UTILITY FROM THE SERVER.

#### CLIENT SIDE
      IT REFERS TO THE OPERATIONS PEFORMED BY THE CLIENT IN THE CLIENT SERVER RELATION. A CLIENT CAN BE ANY COMPUTER WHICH CONNECTS TO THE SEREVER AS NEEDED.
      THIS IS NECESSARY AS THE CLIENT MAY NEED TO PERORM OPERATION OR FUNCTIONS OR ACCESS THE INFORMATION WHICH MAY BE NOT AVAILABLE ON THE USER. IT IS HEPLFUL
      AS SERVER MAY NOT PERFORM THE OPERATION TIMELY TO ALL OF ITS SERVERS AT THE SAME TIME. IT ASLO IS MUCH MORE SECURE THAN WORKING ON THE SERVER EVERYTIME WHICH
      MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF CYBER ATTACKS.

#### SERVER SIDE
      AS THE CLIENT SIDE, THE SERVER SIDE REFERS TO OPERATIONS THAT A SERVER PERFORMS IN CLIENT SERVER RELATION. OPERATIONS NEED TO BE PERFORMED ON THE SERVER SIDE
      AS THE CLEINT MAY BE SLOW, UNRELIABLE OR INSECURE. IT INLCUDE BOTH THE OPERATIONS - THE CLIENT RELATED TASKS AND THE NON CLIENT OPERATIONS SUCH AS MAINTAINENCE TASKS.
